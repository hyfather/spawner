      We use <a href="http://www.heroku.com"
                target="_blank">heroku.com</a> for deploying the Reconcile App and
      making it accessible over the internet. Heroku provides a cloud
      backed platform to install web applications directly. This allows us
      to focus on engineering the Reconcile App instead of worrying about
      servers, uptimes and backups.</p>
    <p>
      Heroku provides a <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.heroku.com/pricing">free-tier</a> which has a
      small amount of processing power and memory at its
      disposal. Although a single instance of
      the Reconcile App can serve mutiple users, it would need more
      computational and memory resources.</p>
    <p>
      So what we are going to do, is spin up a dedicated Reconcile App
      instance on heroku's free-tier just for you and your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heroku makes it trivial to deploy web applications and manage
      them. While we will get you started with this process and even
      manage upgrades of Reconcile App for you, if you'd ever like to
      start owning your heroku instance, email us and we will help you
      to migrate your app with all your existing data.

    <h3>It's really simple!</h3>
    <p>
      Reconcile App is a standard, modern and well-tested Ruby on
      Rails web application. While you can deploy it on a variety of
      platforms with your choice of databases and tooling, we recommend that you go
      with heroku.com. It's because we've tested it and it works great
      on heroku.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source is hosted on github, and the deployment instructions
      are maintained on the ReadMe document here.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've aimed at keeping Reconcile App consistent with the
      guidelines of Ruby on Rails and have kept the deployment
      extremely straightforward to the bare minimum five steps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>git clone</li>
      <li>bundle</li>
      <li>rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare</li>
      <li>rake spec</li>
      <li>deploy!</li>
